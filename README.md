# Podlove Beta Tester

Enable pre-release updates for our WordPress plugins.

**WARNING** Installing this plugin equals ripping off the "WARRANTY VOID IF SEAL BROKEN" sticker. It certainly feels good, but you should only do it if you know what you're doing.

## Install & Update

This plugin is not available through the WordPress plugin directory. You need to install it manually.

1. Download the latest version: https://github.com/podlove/podlove-beta-tester/archive/master.zip
2. In WordPress, go to `Plugins > Add New` and choose "Upload Plugin"
3. Upload the zip file you downloaded in step 1.
4. Once you activated the plugin, go to `Settings > Podlove Beta Tester` and choose the beta you you want to join. Check for plugin updates and you should see a beta update (look at the version number). Note that you only see betas for plugins you have already installed (meaning, for example, you need to have the "Podlove Publisher" plugin if you want to join its beta).

Once you have the plugin installed and active, it will receive updates normally. The only difference being that the updates are served by us instead of WordPress. But the user experience is identical.

## Leaving Betas

To leave a beta, go to `Settings > Podlove Beta Tester` and "Switch back to stable Version". This restores your last stable version.

If this does not work, deactivate/uninstall the "Podlove Beta Tester" plugin and remove the files of the plugin which tracked the beta branch. Then upload the original files from [wordpress.org/plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).
